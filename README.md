# Project Overview
For the Restaurant Reviews projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage Three, you will take the connected application you yu built in Stage One and Stage Two and add additional functionality. You will add a form to allow users to create their own reviews. If the app is offline, your form will defer updating to the remote database until a connection is established. Finally, youâ€™ll work to optimize your site to meet even stricter performance benchmarks than the previous project, and test again using Lighthouse.

## Installing and running the app

* [x] open project directory on terminal
* [x] install node modules by run this npm i
* [x] install sails global by run this sudo npm i sails -g
* [x] Node.js has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Node just run `http-server`.
* [x] open another terminal on the same directory of project and run `npm start` in the cmd for the api server to run.
* [x] With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8080`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
